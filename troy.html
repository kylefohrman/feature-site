            <li>Carver Scientific, Inc. (aka CSi) successfully closed both Series A & Series B rounds
                and continues to be profitably operating today, 12 years after founding.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Biltmore Technologies, Inc. was acquired by the Woodman Family Trust in
                May 2015 (terms are not in the public domain). The Woodman Family Trust is managed by Nick
                Woodman, CEO, GoPro.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sutures, LLC. Established for the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1209361/">feature film of the
                    same name</a>, which was
                successfully- and profitably-
                monetized beginning Q2, 2009 until the LLC closed in July 2012.</li><br>

        He also successfully led a pre-Series A funding
        close for a 4th
        business entity, US Protein & Enzyme, Inc. ("USPE"). Seed funding from Greenfield Energy in 2011 was secured
        to fund a university
        partnership Troy negotiated, to commercialize the University of Central Florida-developed Chloroplast
        Transformation Technology
        ("CTT"). Following cultivation at scale, the CTT platform produced 1/20th of advertised yields resulting in
        the Company's
        dissolution.

        <h3><i>True Story</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">
            Like tens of thousands of Americans who live on the west coast, I visited Valle de Guadalupe, Mexico (aka
            Mexico's wine country)
            for an extended weekend. While in Mexico, the local cartel successfully broke into my Mercedes and stashed
            over 70
            pounds of fentanyl and a tracking device into the undercarriage, which was promptly discovered upon my
            return through the US border.
            <br>
            <br><b>I have been cleared of any wrongdoing</b> (known as a “Blind Mule”), with search engine results
            apparently only willing to reflect
            the arrest at the border and not the court's subsequent dismissal (<a href="troy/notice.html">view
                here!</a>) and the situation's resolution.
            A case of extraordinarily-bad luck, which will make an interesting chapter in my autobiography one day.
            <br>
            <br><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-fohrman/" target="_blank">Ask me about it!</a></em>
            It's certainly an interesting story, now that everything is behind me.
